The Tree data structure is similar to Linked Lists in that each node contains data and can be linked to other nodes.

But the linked list is a linear data structure which can have only one next node address.
The tree can have multiple next node address, which make them different.

The tree is a hirerarchecial data structure and is similar to the real-life tree just kept upside down.
We can imagine tree like this:
                            --------
                            | Data |
                            --------
                                |
                            -------------
                            |           |
                        --------    --------    
                        | Data |    | Data |
                        --------    --------

There are many types of trees, but some of them are given below which we will see here:
1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree
3. Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree
4. Red Black Tree
5. Segement Tree
